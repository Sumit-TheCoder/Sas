(IN EMMET THE CURSOR SHOULD ALWAYS BE AT LAST OF THE WORD)


div+p+blockquotes    --- div after i want p then i want blockquotes
div+div>p>span>em    --- div after div then we want p inside that div and then span inside the p then emphasize
                        inside that span


span>em^bq            --- it means inside of span there will be emphasize tag and ^ means go one level up
                            and write the tag blockquotes


div#header  or  #header     --- get div with id header.  (if we write only #header then automatically understood)

.mainClass                  --- it will create mainClass with div


ul>li*8                     --- it will create 8 li inside ul

ul>li.item$*4               --- it will create 4 li with class item1,item2... inside ul ($ specifies the number)

                                we can use multiple $ to get the more than one digit 

@-                          --- it means start from the decreasing order 
@1                          --- it will go from 1 
                                we always have to use * in order to write numbering 
                            
p[title="hello world"]      ---  to give custom content

a{Click me}                 --- put content embraced by anchor tag

                                            class with 3 lorem ipsum words

div>(header>ul>li*3>a)+(footer>h1>p)    --- this way we can add multiple tags including all tags inside of them
